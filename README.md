# How to use

- If the server you're playing on has a setting for forced ride perspective, disable it.
- Enter the ride as normal.
- Run the command `/papers focus`. Your ride vehicle should start glowing.
- Your camera will be controlled by the mod while you're riding a vehicle and have a focused vehicle (they do not have 
to be the same).
- You can disable the mod by running `/papers clear`.

# Compatibility
PaPers is designed to work with as many servers as possible. Most servers use the same technique to make rides using 
armour stands, but no two servers are the same, so sometimes things break!
The mod's known to work on the following servers:
- [Imagine Fun](https://imaginefun.net)
- <small>Found another server that the mod works on? Please [make an issue](https://github.com/lucyydotp/passenger-perspective/issues/new) and I'll add it to this list!</small>
